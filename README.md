# README

This is an image repo for the Shopify internship challenge 2021. 
I built this using Rails, PostgreSQL, Bootstrap, and Amazon S3.

I am hosting it on heroku, check it out: https://mojan-image-repo.herokuapp.com

Functionality: 
- you can upload a new post that will be added to the repo and stored on an S3 bucket. 
- you can then search images by their titile or body.
- you can delete and update posts.
